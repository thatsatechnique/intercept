- Stock SDR antenna may work at close range near airports
- Outdoor placement with clear sky view significantly improves reception

## ADS-B History (Optional)

The history dashboard persists aircraft messages and per-aircraft snapshots to Postgres for long-running tracking and reporting.

### Enable History

Set the following environment variables (Docker recommended):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INTERCEPT_ADSB_HISTORY_ENABLED` | `false` | Enables history storage and reporting |
| `INTERCEPT_ADSB_DB_HOST` | `localhost` | Postgres host (use `adsb_db` in Docker) |
| `INTERCEPT_ADSB_DB_PORT` | `5432` | Postgres port |
| `INTERCEPT_ADSB_DB_NAME` | `intercept_adsb` | Database name |
| `INTERCEPT_ADSB_DB_USER` | `intercept` | Database user |
| `INTERCEPT_ADSB_DB_PASSWORD` | `intercept` | Database password |

### Other ADS-B Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INTERCEPT_ADSB_AUTO_START` | `false` | Auto-start ADS-B tracking when the dashboard loads |
| `INTERCEPT_SHARED_OBSERVER_LOCATION` | `true` | Share observer location across ADS-B/AIS/SSTV/Satellite modules |

**Local install example**

```bash
INTERCEPT_ADSB_AUTO_START=true \
INTERCEPT_SHARED_OBSERVER_LOCATION=false \
sudo ./start.sh
```

**Docker example (.env)**

```bash
INTERCEPT_ADSB_AUTO_START=true
INTERCEPT_SHARED_OBSERVER_LOCATION=false
```

### Docker Setup

`docker-compose.yml` includes an `adsb_db` service and a persistent volume for history storage:

```bash
docker compose --profile history up -d
```

To store Postgres data on external storage, set `PGDATA_PATH` (defaults to `./pgdata`):

```bash
PGDATA_PATH=/mnt/usbpi1/intercept/pgdata
```

### Using the History Dashboard

1. Open **/adsb/history**
2. Use **Start Tracking** to run ADS-B in headless mode
3. View aircraft history and timelines
4. Stop tracking when desired (session history is recorded)

If the History dashboard shows **HISTORY DISABLED**, enable `INTERCEPT_ADSB_HISTORY_ENABLED=true` and ensure Postgres is running.

- **Needs Review (3-5)** - Unusual devices requiring assessment
- **High Interest (6+)** - Multiple indicators warrant investigation

### Tips

- Record a baseline in a known clean environment before conducting sweeps
- Use the meeting window feature to flag new RF signatures during sensitive periods
- Full functionality requires WiFi adapter, Bluetooth adapter, and SDR hardware
- Threat detection uses a database of 47K+ known tracker fingerprints

4. **Set Tile Provider** - Choose a map tile provider or enter a custom tile server URL
5. **Check Assets** - Click "Check Assets" to verify all local files are present

### Tips

- Download required assets: Leaflet JS/CSS, Chart.js, Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts
- Assets are stored in the `static/vendor/` directory
- For maps, you need a local tile server (e.g., self-hosted OpenStreetMap tiles)
- Missing assets fail gracefully with console warnings
- Useful for air-gapped environments, field deployments, or reducing latency

## Remote Agents (Distributed SIGINT)

Deploy lightweight sensor nodes across multiple locations and aggregate data to a central controller.

### Setting Up an Agent

1. **Install INTERCEPT** on the remote machine
2. **Create config file** (`intercept_agent.cfg`):
   ```ini
   [agent]
   name = sensor-node-1
   port = 8020

   [controller]
   url = http://192.168.1.100:5050
   api_key = your-secret-key
   push_enabled = true

   [modes]
   pager = true
   sensor = true
   adsb = true
   ```
3. **Start the agent**:
   ```bash
   python intercept_agent.py --config intercept_agent.cfg
   ```

### Registering Agents in the Controller

1. Navigate to `/controller/manage` in the main INTERCEPT instance
2. Enter agent details:
   - **Name**: Must match config file (e.g., `sensor-node-1`)
   - **Base URL**: Agent address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:8020`)
   - **API Key**: Must match config file
3. Click "Register Agent"
4. Use "Test" to verify connectivity

### Using Remote Agents

Once registered, agents appear in mode dropdowns:

1. **Select agent** from the dropdown in supported modes
2. **Start mode** - Commands are proxied to the remote agent
3. **View data** - Data streams back to your browser via SSE

### Multi-Agent Streaming

Enable "Show All Agents" to aggregate data from all registered agents simultaneously.

For complete documentation, see [Distributed Agents Guide](DISTRIBUTED_AGENTS.md).

## Configuration

INTERCEPT can be configured via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INTERCEPT_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Server bind address |
| `INTERCEPT_PORT` | `5050` | Server port |
| `INTERCEPT_DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug mode |
| `INTERCEPT_LOG_LEVEL` | `WARNING` | Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) |
| `INTERCEPT_DEFAULT_GAIN` | `40` | Default RTL-SDR gain |

Example: `INTERCEPT_PORT=8080 sudo ./start.sh`

## Command-line Options

### Production server (recommended)

```
sudo ./start.sh --help

  -p, --port PORT    Port to listen on (default: 5050)
  -H, --host HOST    Host to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
  -d, --debug        Run in debug mode (Flask dev server)
  --https            Enable HTTPS with self-signed certificate
  --check-deps       Check dependencies and exit
```

> **Note:** `sudo` is required for SDR hardware access, WiFi monitor mode, and Bluetooth low-level operations.

`start.sh` auto-detects gunicorn + gevent and runs a production WSGI server with cooperative greenlets — this handles multiple SSE streams and WebSocket connections concurrently without blocking. Falls back to the Flask dev server if gunicorn is not installed.

### Development server

```
python3 intercept.py --help

  -p, --port PORT    Port to run server on (default: 5050)
  -H, --host HOST    Host to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
  -d, --debug        Enable debug mode
  --check-deps       Check dependencies and exit
```
